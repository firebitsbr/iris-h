# IRIS-H Digital Forensics Tool

IRIS-H is an online digital forensics tool that performs automated static analysis of files stored in a directory-based or strictly structured formats.

The tool produces two types of data views allowing for thorough digital forensics examination. The first view is called "Report"; it summarises facts derived from the analysed file. Where applicable, the second view called "Workbench" is available to allow for binary level data analysis. Both views are enriched with data descriptions as per official file specification documentation. IRIS-H is also fitted with rule-based code logic that attempts to identify the risk level associated with opening the analysed file on a computer system.
